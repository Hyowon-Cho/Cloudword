    "selftext": "My wife and I ordered a replacement for her Alfa Romeo Giulia back in March of this year and took delivery 6 weeks ago. We’ve since put almost 1500 miles on the car and I wanted to share some of my thoughts as a first time owner of the brand given I know Audi’s most recent direction has been controversial for many.\n\nPhotos here: https://imgur.com/a/F4Epyda\n\nWe spec’d everyone option aside from the dynamic plus package that has the carbon ceramic front brakes given we felt that would be overkill for a daily driver.\n\nComing from the Giulia, the car is a massive step up / advancement in terms of tech and power. Having adjustable interior ambient lighting, 6 different drive modes, a dedicated drift mode, multiple suspension, powertrain, traction settings, race mode, etc really give this car a huge breadth of adjustability to be tailored to anyone’s driving style. \n\nThe interior materials are nice and I’m personally a big fan of the new steering wheel and the Alcantara feels great though I know it will be tricky to maintain. I don’t like the piano black around the center console but that’s really my only big gripe about the interior.\n\nThe Giulia’s handling was still better and it’s dynamically one of the best cars I’ve ever driven but the RS3 isn’t too far behind. Audi was able to improve the car’s lap time around the Nurburgring by 8 second without any power adjustment for this 8Y.5 generation to get it the compact car record lap time. I don’t have a prior point of comparison but a friend that has an 8V drove our car and said it’s dynamically a completely different car in terms of feel.\n\nI love the quirks of having wider front tires than the rear and the 5 cylinder engine. I think these are unique things that make the car feel even more special than it already is.\n\nThe weird badging change for the RS to be separated from the red diamond is silly but not a deal breaker by any means and removing the front RS badge I’ve seen as a complaint online but the GTR gets enough attention as is so it’s nice for this one to be more of a sleeper for us.\n\nOverall, we’re extremely happy with the car and I’ve found myself spending more time driving it over the GTR which has helped make the GTR feel more special every time I get back inside of it - it’s been a proper win/win and I don’t think there was a better sporty 4 door for the money.\n\nIt genuinely puts a smile of my face and feels like a go kart around town. We don’t track our cars so these are pavement warriors and both are fantastic on the road. Might end up throwing on an exhaust and some spacers but that’s likely it - love out the spec came out in person and I think Audi set this car up nicely from the factory."

    "selftext": "To preface, Hyundai didn't sponsor this post or request it. However, I feel like I owe it to them to share the experience beyond my Instagram post that got 21 likes. There are a lot of words, but it was a long day.\n\nTL;DR - Hyundai, HOD, and Monticello Motor Club made an unforgettable day for Hyundai N owners.\n\n\"It's the most fun you can have with your clothes on\" - Unnamed HOD Instructor\n\nOn 8/9 Hyundai hosted their first HPDE for \"N\" owners on the East Coast at the beautiful Monticello Motor Club. It was run between Hyundai NA and Hooked On Driving along with the Monticello staff and cost a whole $0 for those attending.  After staying the night nearby, I worked my way through the backroads of NY, windows down, enjoying the cool 5:30 a.m. air on the way to Monticello. Figuring I'd be early, I was taking it easy and trying to mentally plan for what happens if I punch my car into a tire wall.  Eventually I fell in line behind 3 other Hyundai N cars and we stayed linked up until we got to the track...or rather we got to the 40+ car waiting line to enter the track. Every type of Hyundai N, from stock to heavily modified, was stretched along the side road near the track just waiting for the gates to open. Keep in mind, I was there 15+ minutes early and was middle of the pack. To say everyone was excited is as much of an understatement as saying I was \"a little nervous.\"\n\nI parked my car ('24 Elantra N) and walked up and down the impromptu side road parade a few times while 50 or more cars showed up. The gates opened up right at 6:00 a.m. and we had our first taste of the Monticello Motor Club grounds. Passing (slowly) through the access road, the first sign of Hyundai's investment in the event was the two Elantra TCR cars parked in front of the main pit area/dining/gift shop along with feather banners and staff milling about. Going up a bit further, everyone made their way to the main staging lot below the \"Gallery\". More on that building later. \n\nAfter parking, we all filtered into the aforementioned do-it-all building, got our swag bags, track numbers, and ate a light breakfast while listening to the first of Hooked On Driving's (HOD's) instruction.  I drank enough coffee to ensure I remembered every word possible because I knew it was the difference between a fun day on track vs. a not-so-fun ride in an ambulance.  The instructors went over safety basics like passing rules, flag meanings, passing zones, scheduling, and group assignments. Then we went back to our cars to get ready for the moment so many were itching for.  \n  \nAs part of the “no idea what we’re doing” i.e. beginner group, I emptied my car, stashed my things with a new friend (pro tip: bring a Rubbermaid tub), and drove into pit lane.  After putting my Nomex balaclava on the wrong way, fixing it, and getting on my helmet, I was ready for my first time on track. Instructor in the passenger seat and earpiece tucked into my helmet, we slowly entered the track at the blend line (see, I paid attention in the first session) and started our 3.4mi journey around the full Monticello circuit.\n\nHere's where it starts to get good.  While this was the \"yellow flag\" lap, all that really means is no passing and don't give it the full can of beans. For someone who had never been on track, I was already having a great time trying to find the line and listening to my instructor give running direction on how to improve. 20 minutes later, the first session was done and I was headed back to the staging lot. \n\nFrom there, the day started racing by. There were 2 more classroom sessions, 5 more sessions, and more fun than I ever dreamed. Thanks to incredible instructors and a wildly capable, fully stock car, I truly had one of the best experiences of my life. Going out each session and settling into the seat as you come out of the pits, your mind goes to one thing, and that's driving. You start to brake later, harder, smoother, all while getting closer to each apex and using up more pavement. On the 3/4mi straight, you don't even think about how you're going 130mph, rather you're looking ahead for the braking markers and turning your eyes up track for the hard right-hander into the chicane. No cops. No deer. Instead, just a very peaceful focus. To say it was addictive really isn't doing it justice. The moment I got home I was hunting for more HOD events, and looking into a spare set of wheels and tires. Speaking of, the car itself was rock-steady the whole time.\n\nWhile not the subject of this post, a stock vehicle that is able to turn 4-5 laps like that on an 85f+ day is pretty good, let alone one that is $35k. My car didn't even see brake fade on stock fluid, although I do plan on putting in some Motul 660 next time. On that note, I've typed too much, so here are some photos for those who read the whole thing or skipped to the end - [https://imgur.com/a/1WRl9KC](https://imgur.com/a/1WRl9KC)"

If you gotta come at me, remember these are my SUBJECTIVE rankings!\n\n||Style|Comfort|Sportiness|Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Acura TLX|9|9|7|25|\n|Cadillac CT4-V|8|8|8|24|\n|Mercedes C300|7|8|7|22|\n|Alfa Giulia|6|6|8|20|\n|BMW 330xi|5|8|7|20|\n|Tesla 3 (Pre-facelift)|5|5|8|18|\n\n**Tesla Model 3** \n\n* Feels like a sporty car but does not feel luxurious at all\n* Turn in as quick as a Toyota 86, unfortunately also rides like one\n* Novelty of speed wears off, then becomes a pretty boring car\n\n**BMW 330xi** \n\n* Highest performance but has a disconnected feel.  Zero change in steering feel even at handling limits\n* Surprisingly plush ride\n* Slapped-on screen design is very unattractive to me \n* Too common, styling not distinct\n\n**Alfa Giulia**\n\n* Most planted feel of the bunch, direct steering\n* Uninspiring engine - lives in low revs, does not want or need to be wrung out\n* Feels a bit too firm/serious for what I'm looking for\n\n**Mercedes C300 4Matic (Last generation)**\n\n* Surprisingly great handling - feels neutral and tail comes around a bit  in hard cornering\n* Very peppy engine. Transmission shifts pretty quickly too.\n* Cheap feeling and creaky interior plastics - maybe solved with the new generation\n* Great comfort/sporty balance. Great car but too common for me to want one\n\n**Cadillac CT4-V**\n\n* Cool exterior, love the rear end especially.  Interior is ergonomically great with expensive feeling hard buttons but is a bit gray overall\n* Back seat is small\n* Surprisingly great handling especially with magneride.  Very quick to change directions, car moves all in one piece, yet ride is very supple \n* Annoying constant high pitched engine whine in one of the examples I drove, even though GM says this is normal, other examples I drove did not make this sound!\n\n**Acura TLX A-Spec**\n\n* Very comfortable - you sink into the seats and car feels pretty unbothered by bumps \n* Sporty enough - torquey engine, transmission works great around town, you can throw it into corners and it does not feel sloppy\n*  Has a big car presence that I like..the stance and width of the car is impressive. Looks interesting inside and out. \n* Great size of back seat and trunk space - I think the small back seat complaint about this car is so overblown.  I'm 5'10\".  \n\nIn conclusion I'm pretty happy with the TLX.  It has a relaxed, easygoing feel but is still up to the task on a winding road, even though I may upgrade the squealy tires later on.  I like that Acura took chances with the interior design and didn't just slap a touchscreen on.   The touchpad isn't perfect for sure, but for simple operations it's actually really easy and you don't have to lift your hand.\n\n  \nOther cars I considered for a minute:\n\nLexus ES - Ride is not as plush as I expected.  Only drove older ESes but seems too boring to drive\n\nLexus IS - I like the V6 and exterior a lot, but too dated and small inside\n\nAudi A4 - Seems boring in character and looks.  But excellent build quality "

It doesn't necessarily have to be a high-performance car or a complex build. Custom body work would probably help to make it more iconic but just a cool design can go a long way. KITT isn't heavily modified (at least not on the exterior) but it has managed to become one of the most iconic cars. Cars that [borrow design cues](https://www.reddit.com/r/AwesomeCarMods/comments/1gvfrl9/is_there_a_recognized_name_for_this_style_of/) count but cars [based on existing characters/movies/shows/etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/AwesomeCarMods/comments/1mzh8rk/this_wolverine_mod_that_i_saw_isnt_too_involved/) do not. I'm most interested in amateur mods but one-off professional builds are fine too, as long as it looks iconic and awesome."
